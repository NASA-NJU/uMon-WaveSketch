# Î¼Mon Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of SIGCOMM'24 paper 'Empowering Microsecond-level Network Monitoring with Wavelets'.

This repository contains the cpp/python version of the WaveSketch and part of the data trace (the whole trace is too large) used in the paper. 

The Python version gives a straight-forward logic about how WaveSketch is implemented and worked.

The CPP version can reproduce the evaluation results in the paper.
